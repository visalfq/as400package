Profound.js greatly simplifies the development of full-stack database-driven applications. It helps in both creating new applications and modernizing legacy code.

The quickest way to explore Profound.js is to visit https://profoundjs.com, our online IDE and runtime environment. 


## Installation

To install Profound.js, create a new directory and issue the command "npm install profoundjs" as follows:

```
mkdir profoundjs
cd profoundjs
npm install profoundjs
```

Follow the npm install prompts to complete the installation.

When installing Profound.js on IBM i, you will also be prompted to install Profound.js Connector for IBM i ILE components. These components are required for many of the features provided by Profound.js for IBM i.

## Usage

The Profound.js installation process will create a start.js file in your directory. It will look something like this:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

// Load Profound.js
const profoundjs = require("profoundjs");

// Apply configuration
await profoundjs.applyConfig();

// Start Profound.js server
await profoundjs.server.listen();

// This is the top-level Express Application.
// Custom Express coding can be added here.
var express = profoundjs.server.express;
var app = profoundjs.server.app;
app.use(express.json());  // default to use JSON-encoded post data
```

Using Node, the server can be started as follows:

`node start.js`

Or, it can be started using the STRTCPSVR command on IBM i.
